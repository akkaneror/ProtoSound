Introduction  
------------  

ProtoSound is an Android-based application for commercial smartphones that allows users to customize their sound recognition models and receive private sound feedback in a different contexts.

It adapts prototypical networks, a commonly used algorithm for few-shot image classification, to the sound classification domain while extending the traditional training pipeline to incorporate additional user-centric features for real-world deployment.

The project is inspired by previous sound awareness work with DHH users, our DHH lead author's experiences, and a survey of 472 DHH participants. According to field evaluations with a real-life dataset and an interactive mobile application, ProtoSound can be used to build sound recognition systems that support highly personalized and fine-grained sound categories, can train on-device in real-time, and can handle contextual variations in a variety of real-world contexts using few custom recordings.

## Prerequisites ##  
--------------  
- Latest Android Studio (The project is developed with Android Studio 4.0)  
- Android SDK 28  
- Android Build Tools v28.0.3  
- Android Support Repository  
- Get the sound classification Tensorflow lite model and the label files that are open sourced [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wngu1kuufwdk8nr/AAC1rm5QR-amL_HBzTOgsZnca?dl=0)

Configuration  
-------------  
  
- Let gradle configure and install dependencies for the `app` project.   
- On top toolbar of Android Studio, make sure `app` is chosen and click `Run` button.
  
  
    
## Frequently Asked Questions ##  
-------  

<b>How does the option "New" in step 2 work?</b>  
- You are prompted to enter a name for your sound and record the sound 5 times. Each recording is 1-second long, which means there are 5 1-second samples. You can play the recording back to see if it is the sound that you want. You can also record again for the same slot when you tap on the "Recorded" button.  
  
 <b>Will my submitted locations and self-recorded sounds be saved?</b>  
  - Yes. Once you submit a location in step 1, the location is saved and you can access it again when you choose <b>Existing</b> for step 1. As for your recorded sounds, once you train the model, the sounds will be saved with the associated location for later access.  
    For example, if you save "talking" with your location "bedroom". If you select "bedroom" from step 1, "talking" will be in the list of sounds when you choose EXISTING in step 2.  

  
<b>Why does Predict not return any result for my sound?</b>  
- There are a couple of reasons. You might not have trained the sounds yet or the app simply does not recognize your untrained sound.  
  
<b>Why does Predict return incorrect results for a sound when I have trained it?</b>  
- It could be that within your trained dataset, there is low variance among the different sounds which leads to high errors. Alternatively, if a sound is trained through "Your Choice", the 5 recordings may capture vastly different sound waves for a particular sound and this can lead to inconsistencies when getting predictions.  

  
<b>After training 5 sounds, can I train different sounds?</b>  
- Yes. After training 5 sounds, you can make necessary changes on the <b>Train</b> tab then tap on "TRAIN" to train the sounds again.
